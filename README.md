Man in the Detection research paper uses a 4G network. This repo is fork from [srsRAN project](https://www.srsran.com).
Without any modifications to the source code, except to configure the frequency of operation, we use the project as is.

eNb configuration file with modications is in the [repo](https://github.com/shotsan/4G_eNodeB_EPC/blob/3956297891cd4739f450ac30dc2ac81006304ccf/enb.conf)



## Instructions to run eNb and EPC

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/shotsan/4G_eNodeB_EPC/
```

2. Install UHD to use USRP, we used USRP X310 which interfaces to the host machine through ethernet interface.
